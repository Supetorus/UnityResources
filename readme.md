This is a collection of Unity Scripts compiled from my time at Neumont College of Computer Science. My purpose in publishing this repository is to aid my peers in developing games using Unity Engine.

This collection is provided as is with no guarantees whatsoever. Download and use at your own risk.

I will happily accept contribution in the form of scripts, documentation, organization, and additional links to assets. If it is something you can email to me then you are welcome to do so. Otherwise you may fork this repository, make your changes, and create a pull request. Please make pull requests for one thing at a time, i.e. Don't make a pull request for documentation and adding scripts. Make one PR for adding scripts and one for documentation.

Scripts provided in this repository are free to use, modify, and distribute for personal, educational, and commercial purposes.
